# This class takes as input an Array of cities, a string that partially matches
# the names of these cities, and optionally the latitude and longitude of the
# user. It is responsible for assigning a score to each city, which represets
# how confident it is that the user is attempting to select each of the cities. The array
# of cities is then returned in order of confidence, with the most confident
# match at the top.
#
# Scoring is based on three criteria:
# 1. Name completeness:
#     Potentially matching cities for the partial match 'Plymouth' are
#     'Plymouth, PA, USA' and 'Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA'. The closer the
#     partial match is to the full city name, the more likely it is that the
#     person is attempting to match that city, so 'Plymouth, PA, USA' will have
#     a higher confidence score.
# 2. Population:
#     Buses are more likely to depart from cities with higher populations, and an
#     individual is more likely to be living in a city with more people.
#     Therefore, cities with higher populations are assinged a higher confidence score.
# 3. Distance:
#     If the latitude and longitude of the user are given, a closer city will be
#     assigned a higher confidence score.
#
# The highest score that can be assigned to an attribute is 1.0, while the lowest that
# can be assigned is 0.0. A higher score represents a more confident suggestion.
# The total confidence score is a weighted average of the individual attributes, again
# from 0.0 to 1.0, with the following weighting schemes used:
#
# 1. Latitude and longitude provided:
#   0.3 * name completeness score + 0.2 * population score + 0.5 * distance score
# 2. Latitude and longitude not provided:
#   0.6 * name completeness score + 0.4 * population score
#
#
# Expceted usage of the class is as follows:
#
# city_scorer = CityScorer.new(city_list)
# city_scorer.score_cities
# city_scorer.cities_to_hash
# => An array of the cities, sorted descending by score, where each city is of type Hash
